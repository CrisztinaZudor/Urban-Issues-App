# Urban Issues App

**Urban Issues App** is a Streamlit-based web platform that helps identify and track urban problems in Cluj-Napoca through citizen participation and AI. Users can upload photos of public issues, and a YOLOv11 model detects and classifies the problem. The system generates structured reports, stores them in a SQLite database, and displays them on an interactive map. Administrators can manage these reports through a dedicated dashboard.
