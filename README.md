# Urban Issues App

**Urban Issues App** is a citizen-driven reporting system built with AI to detect and track urban problems in Cluj-Napoca. It empowers both citizens and city administrators to collaboratively improve city maintenance. Citizens can upload a photo of a problem they observe, and an AI model automatically identifies the issue and files a structured report. Administrators can then review and manage the status of these reports.

## 🔍 Project Description

This Streamlit-based web application integrates a YOLOv11 object detection model trained on urban infrastructure issues. The app allows:

- **Citizens** to report issues (e.g., potholes, illegal parking, trash) via photo upload.
- **AI model** to detect the issue and generate a structured PDF report.
- **City administrators** to view, filter, and update the status of problems on an interactive map and dashboard.

The system supports multiple user roles (citizens and admins) and maintains persistent reports using SQLite.
